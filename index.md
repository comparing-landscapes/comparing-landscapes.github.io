## Theme 

This conference brings together scholars from **literary studies and digital humanities** to explore representations of *space* and *affect* in literature and literary history, with a focus on two aspects: the **'national' as reference dimension** and the role of **practices of comparing**.

The conference is designed to welcoming a wide range of perspectives: **from literary critique to machine learning, from geospatial to sentiment analysis, from metaphor to historiographic argument.**

We aim at creating an **interdisciplinary event**, where research on the dimensions of space and affect in literary texts are explored with reference to 'national literatures' and practices of comparing at different levels.
This exchange of ideas shall take place among scholars from different faculties and backgrounds, who share an interest for the ways in which space and affect impact literary discourse and literary historiography.

**We are looking forward to host a range of thrilling presentations at the interface between literary studies and data-driven humanities that will look at comparing space and affect in different national literatures and periods.**
